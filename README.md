So this repository is based around a program called drillRunner.py that helps the user run through a drill.

Included are 
    -a renaming program (to rename .wav's to work with drillRunner
    -a labelMaker.py that produces a .txt where each line is a label
    -a Praat script ( D: ) that takes the .txt and labels the TextGrid of a (manually segmented) .wav
    -a Praat script that takes the TextGrid and .wav and extracts labelled intervals, placing them in an appropriate folder
    -and finally, drillRunner.py, which takes these many small .wav's to run through a drill.
